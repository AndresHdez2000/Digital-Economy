# Describe the growth of the digital economy
As we have seen the digital economy is growing and changing as time goes by, this growth is mainly associated with the internet and everything that implies a business model or having profits thanks to different platforms or pages that use the internet. Generally, this growth is characterized by:

- Users have the power of decision and information just clicks away. 
- Data or information grows and is generated so fast and is easy to obtain.
- Everyone can be connected thanks to a computer and the internet.
- Products or services are available anywhere in the world. 

However, the above is only the most general facets or capabilities that the digital transformation has had and that grew or became more popular thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, as there are other more interesting advances that are undoubtedly on another level. One of the simplest examples is the 5G network in smartphones, they may not seem so impressive, but the truth is that the 4G LTE network, the fastest currently in Mexico, had commercial deployment a decade ago. But the technologies that are most interesting and have the potential to become key pieces of technological development are those that are associated with artificial intelligence, distributed technology accounting (DTL) and quantum computing. Just a small proof of this is how AI is being used to monitor and predict the spread of Covid-19 in real time, but this is certainly only one of many fields where it can be applied. As for DTL the blockchain has become the most popular among financial markets as it allows to store data in such a way that it is almost impossible to falsify, finally with quantum computing it is expected to accelerate research and innovation in different fields such as agriculture, energy, aircraft manufacturing, etc.
