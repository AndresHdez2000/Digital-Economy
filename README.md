# Describe the growth of the digital economy
As we have seen the digital economy is growing and changing as time goes by, this growth is mainly associated with the internet and everything that implies a business model or having profits thanks to different platforms or pages that use the internet. Generally, this growth is characterized by:

- Users have the power of decision and information just clicks away. 
- Data or information grows and is generated so fast and is easy to obtain.
- Everyone can be connected thanks to a computer and the internet.
- Products or services are available anywhere in the world. 

However, the above is only the most general facets or capabilities that the digital transformation has had and that grew or became more popular thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, as there are other more interesting advances that are undoubtedly on another level. One of the simplest examples is the 5G network in smartphones, they may not seem so impressive, but the truth is that the 4G LTE network, the fastest currently in Mexico, had commercial deployment a decade ago. But the technologies that are most interesting and have the potential to become key pieces of technological development are those that are associated with artificial intelligence, distributed technology accounting (DTL) and quantum computing. Just a small proof of this is how AI is being used to monitor and predict the spread of Covid-19 in real time, but this is certainly only one of many fields where it can be applied. As for DTL the blockchain has become the most popular among financial markets as it allows to store data in such a way that it is almost impossible to falsify, finally with quantum computing it is expected to accelerate research and innovation in different fields such as agriculture, energy, aircraft manufacturing, etc. 


# The ICT (Information and communication technologies) Indicators

Information technology indicators are essential for the creation of policies and strategies on the growth of ICTs in different fields, without forgetting that they must be accompanied by analysis and statistics to take better advantage of them. Although at first glance it may seem that they are only useful for ICT-related areas, the reality is that they are also useful for inclusion, social cohesion and for follow-up and evaluation of the impact of ICT on economic and social development. 

Some categories or approaches of these indicators are the following:
- Core indicators on ICT infrastructure and access.
- Core indicators on the ICT sector and trade in ICT goods.
- Core indicators on use of ICT by businesses.
- Core indicators on access to, and use of, ICT by households and individual.

# Identify and describe ICT-based business models 
These are some of the basic business-based indicators:
- Proportion of businesses using computers: this point alludes to the utilization of PCs that an organization utilizes during a year time frame. Not forgetting that this can be both portable and non-portable, but not a small component such as smartphones.

- Proportion of employees using computers: This indicator refers to the proportion of employees using a computer in the company, that is, used for the employee's work over a 12-month period and not merely computer access. As with the previous indicator, smartphones or similar objects are not counted as computers.

- Proportion of businesses using the Internet: Refers to the use and access to the Internet in the company in a 12-month reference period, either through a computer or any smart device.

- Proportion of employees using the Internet: this indicator means the proportion of employees who used the Internet to perform their work in a 12-month period and not the simple fact of having access to the Internet.

- Proportion of businesses with a Web presence: Means the measure of the proportion of companies that have a presence on the Internet, that is, a domain and website and control over it.

- Proportion of businesses with an intranet: This indicator alludes to the proportion of companies that have an intranet, which is a network under the same protocol as the Internet allowing communication between the company.
